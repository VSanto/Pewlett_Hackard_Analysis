## Purpose
The purpose of the challenge was to provide a list of retiring employees.  The information provided will help the company know
* What positions will need to be filled.  
* If current employees are eligible for a mentorship. 
* How many new hires will be needed

I started by reading and cleaning up data files using jupyter notebook.  Then transitioned over to SQL to combine the tables to create new tables with all information needed to create a plan to ensure positions do not go empty after employees retire.

First created a list of current employees eligible for retirement.

 Next, I created a retirement table listing the employee information.

Then I cleaned the data removing duplicate employees who have been promoted over the years.

Finally, I created a table providing the total number retiring by title.
